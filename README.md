Version - 1

This is a Simple Quiz app created using React

I have used Open Trivia database to fetch questions and their corrosponding answers 

In the first version of the app I only created a simple interface to start n attempt 
the quiz. After submission it shows answers and player's score 

Version - 2

After this update I have provided some more features like users can now select 
the number of questions also users can select the category of the questions as well 
as user can select the type and difficulties of the questions.

Till now application seems to be working properly.

Version - 3

Till now I was using ternary to navigate between the quiz page and the home page.
In this update I have used React Router to navigate between pages easily.

After the update

1. Now user can go to url/quiz page to directly attempt the quiz but it will have only 5 questions 
although user can change settings any time.

2. Pressing back button while attempting quiz will not terminate the app instead it will bring the user to the home page.

Website seems to be working properly.
