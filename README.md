This is a Simple Quiz app created using React-js

I have used Open Trivia database to fetch questions and their corrosponding answers 

In the first version of the app I only created a simple interface to start n attempt 
the quiz. After submission it shows answers and player's score 

After this major update I have provided some more features like users can now select 
the number of questions also users can select the category of the questions as well 
as user can select the type and difficulties of the questions.

Till now application seems to be working properly.
